 contains your application key prior to calling this method.  On calling this
 method, a connection is established with the speech server and authorization
 details are exchanged.  This provides the necessary setup to perform
 recognitions and vocalizations.  In addition, having the established connection
 results in improved response times for speech requests made soon after as the
 recorded audio can be sent without waiting for a connection.  Once the system
 has been initialized with this function, future calls to setupWithID will be
 ignored.  If you wish to connect to a different server or call this function
 again for any reason, you must call [SpeechKit destroy] and wait for the
 destroyed delegate method to be called.

 @param certSummary Certificate Summary could be nil, if non-nil, it should not be empty
 This parameter is important to specify in order to prevent man-in-the-middle (MITM)
 attack styles where the middle man has a valid certificate but different than the expected target.
 The value of the string is a partial or fully-qualified domain name (FQDN) and may include a star (asterisk) for wildcard
 certificates - exactly as specified in the CN field of the server X.509. (example: *.nuancemobility.net)
 @param certData Certificate Data could be nil, if non-nil, it should not be empty
 
 If this value is specified:
 After standard certificate validity checks are complete, certificates in the chain of trust are byte-compared in sequence against this certificate
 from the target server host (the tip of the chain of trust) back to the root CA, until the first match is found.
 Any match means that the connection is allowed.  If none match, the connection is disallowed.
 
 Therefore, this parameter can be used to either provide a strong target host check, or to "pin" the chain of trust to a specific root
 or intermediate CA.  If the encoded certificate is a CA rather than the target server CN, it is important to also specify the sslSummary.
 Otherwise, the sslSummary is redundant and not strictly necessary.
 
 Since the encoded certificates contain validity dates and other items, certificate rotation 
 needs should be considered in the client design when using this parameter.
 @param delegate The receiver for the setup message responses.  If the user
 wishes to destroy and re-connect to the SpeechKit servers, the delegate must

 @discussion This method frees the resources of the SpeechKit framework and 
 tears down any existing connections to the server.  It is usually not necessary
 to call this function, however, if you need to connect to a different server or
 port, it is necessary to call this function before calling setupWithID again.
 You must wait for the destroyed delegate method of the SpeechKitDelegate
 protocol to be called before calling setupWithID again.  Note also you will need
 to call setEarcon again to set up all your earcons after using this method.
 This function should NOT be called during an active recording or vocalization -
 you must first cancel the active transaction.  Calling it while the system is
 not idle may cause unpredictable results.
