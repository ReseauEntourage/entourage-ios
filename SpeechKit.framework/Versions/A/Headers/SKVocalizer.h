 @abstract Returns a SKVocalizer initialized with a language.
 
 @param language The language tag in the format of the ISO 639 language code, 
 followed by an underscore "_", followed by the ISO 3166-1 country code.  This 
 language should correspond to the language of the text provided to the 
 speakString: method.  
 See http://dragonmobile.nuancemobiledeveloper.com/public/index.php?task=faq 
 for a list of supported languages and voices.
 @param delegate The delegate receiver for status messages sent by the 
 vocalizer.
 
 @discussion This initializer configures a vocalizer object for use as a 
 text to speech service.  A default voice will be chosen by the server based on 
 the language selection.  After initializing, the speak methods can be called 
 repeatedly to enqueue sequences of spoken text.  Each spoken string will 
 result in one or more delegate methods called to inform the receiver of 
 speech progress.  At any point speech can be stopped with the cancel method.

 @abstract Returns a SKVocalizer initialized with a specific voice.
 
 @param voice The specific voice to use for speech.  The list of supported 
 voices sorted by language can be found at

 @param delegate The delegate receiver for status messages sent by the 
 vocalizer.
 
 @discussion This initializer provides more fine grained control than the 
 initWithLanguage: method by allowing for the selection of a particular voice.  
 For example, this allows for explicit choice between male and female voices in 
 some languages.  The SKVocalizer object returned may be used exactly as 
 initialized in the initWithLanguage: case.

 return immediately.  The text will be spoken as the server begins to stream 
 audio and delegate methods will be synchronized to the audio to indicate 
 speech progress.

 the exception that the markup within the markup string will be processed by 
 the server according to SSML standards.  This allows for more fine grained 
 control over the speech.

 @discussion The SKVocalizerDelegate protocol defines the methods sent by the 
 SKVocalizer class during the speech synthesis process.  These methods provide 
 progress information regarding the speech process and are all optional.  
 Since the vocalizer will automatically queue sequential speech reuqests, it is 
 not even necessary to know when a speech request has finished.

 will be called when the audio begins playing.  If there is no valid audio for

 sent to the speakString: methods.  In the case that there are no errors, this 
 method will be called when the speech playback finishes with error set to 
 nil.  If there is an error at any stage of the speech request, this method
