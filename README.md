Our goal is to create a local social network on smartphones to help the HOMELESS people fight their loneliness thru collaborative actions with neighbours.


## Getting Started

...

## Upload Symbols to Firebase

Crashlytics requires you to upload debug symbols.
You can use a run script build phase for Xcode to automatically upload debug symbols post-build. Find the run script here:
${BUILD_DIR%Build/*}/SourcePackages/checkouts/firebase-ios-sdk/Crashlytics/run

Another option for uploading symbols is to use the [upload-symbols](https://github.com/firebase/firebase-ios-sdk/raw/master/Crashlytics/upload-symbols) script. Place the script in a subdirectory of your project file (for example scripts/upload-symbols), then make sure that the script is executable:
chmod +x scripts/upload-symbols
This script can be used to manually upload dSYM files. For usage notes and additional instructions for the script, run upload-symbols without any parameters.
